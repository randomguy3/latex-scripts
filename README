This is a simple Rake-based infrastructure for building LaTeX files into PDFs.

It runs pdflatex the necessary number of times to get cross-references right,
including any from the bibliography.  It will automatically run BibTeX on any
bib files referenced in a \bibliography{} command in the LaTeX document.

If there are unresolved references or citations, it will warn about them,
listing the ones that could not be found.  It will also warn about TODOs,
providing the included commands in tex/todo.tex are used.

The main part of the script is in build.rb.  This should just be dropped into
the same directory as the LaTeX file.  Customisation for a particular LaTeX file
happens in the Rakefile.

* $MAIN_JOB specifies the base name of the tex file
* $DIST_NAME is the name of the final version of the pdf, and of the archive
* $EXTRA_INCLUDES allows extra files to be added

The script works by copying all files into a build directory, and running
pdflatex from that directory.  This keeps your working directory clean, and
allows you to structure your files (particuarly included files) while treating
them as being in the current directory from within your LaTeX file.

The script will find standard TeX files (*.tex, *.sty, *.cls, *.clo,*.bst) from
the current directory or the "tex" subdirectory.  It will also find TikZ diagrams
(*.tikz) and images (*.pdf, *.png, *.jpg) that are in the "figures"
subdirectory.  Any other files can be added to $EXTRA_INCLUDES.

It is possible to override the LaTeX and BibTeX commands using the LATEX and
BIBTEX global variables or environment variables, although bear in mind that the
script expects certain arguments to be accepted and the log output to be of a
certain form.

* `rake`: produce $MAIN_JOB.pdf in the current directory.
* `rake draft` will do the same.
* `rake final` will turn warnings into errors and produce $DIST_NAME.pdf in the
  current directory.
* `rake view` will create the draft and attempt to open it in a suitable
  viewing application.
* `rake tar` will create a gzipped tar file of files, without any of the
  directory structure or the build scripts.  This is useful for uploading to
  the arXiv, for example.
* `rake clean` will delete the build directory and any created archive.
